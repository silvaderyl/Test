    <h2>How to get free crypto</h2>
    <p class=" published"> Published Feb 20,2022</p>
    <h3># Brave Browser</h3>
    <p>
    <div> have been using brave for 8 months now. It gave me everything a normal browser like Google
        Chrome provides but
        more. Brave is created by the creators of Mozilla and as a user, I can deny that Brave is
        not a scam. Their
        vision is to cut the middleman between advertisers and users.</div> <br>
    <div> You can make money (not a bunch, but still worth it because itâ€™s free) from brave by just
        viewing the ads.
        Their policy is the ad viewer should be also get paid for viewing the ads (free money !!).
        Unlike any other
        browser,
        brave wonâ€™t force you to view all the ads. There is an option, where you can opt for their
        ad program and get
        money or not view ads at all. If you donâ€™t want to make money, you can use brave as a
        premium browser. There
        wonâ€™t be any ads even on YouTube (YouTube premium for lifetime baby...!!) if you donâ€™t want
        to opt for their ad
        program. </div><br>

    <div>
        Brave pays money in terms of Cryptocurrency called BAT (Iâ€™m BATMAN ðŸ¦‡) which is the acronym
        for Basic Attention
        Token. It is an ERC-20 token built on top of Ethereum.
    </div><br>
    </p>

    <h3># Coinbase</h3>
    <p> Coinbase is one of the top centralized exchanges in the world. You can make free money by
        watching learning
        videos and answering the questions in Coinbase. Mostly the videos and lectures will be about a
        new token and
        how
        it works. And you can answer every question easily. The videos and lectures are quite short and
        wonâ€™t take
        much
        of your time (most less than 1 minute). I had made around $40 with Coinbase just by learning
        about new
        tokens.<br>
    <div>
        You can easily set up an account with Coinbase but must wait some time to get the KYC. Once
        you set up
        everything you can start learning about the new tokens and cryptocurrencies and get paid.
        Once you get paid
        in
        crypto you can do what wish with it. Either you can spend it, keep it for a long term (to
        the moonâ€¦ ðŸš€) or
        you
        can convert it to any other crypto just like I do.</div>
